Hello and welcome to my bioinformatics experience. This repository was purposely created for single cell RNA-Seq using scanpy. The data was downloaded from the CZI, all credit goes to the curators.

## Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls: identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune dysregulation.


#### Research objectives:

1. To characterize the cellular composition and gene expression profiles of PBMCs from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).
2. To identify changes in immune cell populations and gene expression profiles associated with COVID-19 infection and healthy controls.
3. To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in COVID-19.
4. To identify potential biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting.

#### Research questions:

1. What are the changes in immune cell populations and gene expression profiles in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls?
2. Which cell types contribute to immune dysregulation in COVID-19?
3. What are the key signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators involved in COVID-19 immune dysregulation?
4. Can scRNA-seq identify potential biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting?

#### Potential impact:

1. Elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in COVID-19.
2. Identify potential biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting.
3. Inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
