Hello and welcome to my bioinformatics experience. This repository was purposely created for single cell RNA-Seq using scanpy. The data was downloaded from the CZI, all credit goes to the curators.



## Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls: identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune dysregulation.


#### Research objectives:

1. To characterize the cellular composition and gene expression profiles of PBMCs from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).
2. To identify changes in immune cell populations and gene expression profiles associated with COVID-19 infection and disease severity.
3. To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in COVID-19, including changes in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell function.
4. To identify potential biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting.

#### Research questions:

1. What are the changes in immune cell populations and gene expression profiles in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls?
2. How do T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subsets contribute to immune dysregulation in COVID-19?
3. What are the key signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators involved in COVID-19 immune dysregulation?
4. Can scRNA-seq identify potential biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting?

#### Experimental design:

1. Collect PBMCs from COVID-19 patients (n=10-20) and healthy controls (n=10-20).
2. Perform scRNA-seq using a platform such as 10x Genomics or Drop-seq.
3. Analyze data using bioinformatics pipelines, including cell type identification, differential gene expression, and trajectory analysis.
4. Validate findings using orthogonal methods, such as flow cytometry and qRT-PCR.

#### Potential impact:

1. Elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in COVID-19.
2. Identify potential biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting.
3. Inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
